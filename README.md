SYNOPSIS:
	This is a Java based project that implements three Nature Inspired Algorithms:
		1. Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO).
		2. River Formation Dynamics algorithm (RFD).
		3. Cuckoo Search algorithm.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
	1. NETBEANS
	2. JDK 1.6 or higher.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION:
	1. Create a new folder in location "Documents/NetBeansProjects/" and name it something e.g., "NEW_FOLDER".
